Steps to follow:

1.  First you need a text editor that can read/write Plain Text files without interpreting them as a web page.
    Here are the two standards:

    Windows - Open Notepad.exe

    Mac - Open TextEdit and then select Preferences from the TextEdit menu.  Under the "Opening and Saving" tab,
          check the box that says "Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text."

          This tells TextEdit to keep your HTML files in their raw code form.  Otherwise, TextEdit will show
          your HTML file as a web page and you won't be able to edit the raw code.

2.  Open lesson_0_template.html in your text editor.

3.  Paste your questions and answers where indicated between the <pre> ... </pre> tags.

    a.  To see your changes, save the file according to your assigned filename and load it in a web browser.
        - The file extension MUST be .html
        - You MUST follow the filename assigned to you.
        - You MUST save the file as a plain-text file.  Do not use Word or anything other than a plain text editor.

    b.  If your webpage uses local images, name them starting with your assigned file name.  For example,
          p2_lesson_6a_happyface.jpg

    c.  Open lesson_0_example.html in a text editor and a web browser to see the html code and what it produces.

4.  When done, upload your html file and any resource files needed (images, input files, starter code, etc) to the submission form.

    Reminder:  You MUST follow the filename assigned to you or you'll lose points.
